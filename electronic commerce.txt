buyer. One of the most successful online auction sites is eBay, which is an 
example of a C2C e-commerce site. eBay’s website allows anyone to list 
products that they want to be auctioned. When sellers list their products, they 
fill out a form on eBay that allows them to describe the product, provide a 
picture of it, and also specify a base price that they want for it. 
After the form filling, the product is listed on eBay’s site, and bidding by buyers 
is permitted for a fixed period of time, usually one week. Bidding brings up the 
price, and at the close of the bidding period, the bid of the highest bidder is 
accepted, and he/she is declared the winner. The buyer and the seller then 
exchange money and goods independently of eBay. After the auction, eBay 
permits buyers and sellers to rate each other. This rating is publicly declared 
and forms a basis for building the reputations of buyers and sellers. Sellers 
with high ratings are able to attract more and higher bids for their products. 
Auction sites are subject to strong network effects. Successful auction sites 
attract more and more buyers and sellers, who are then weaned away from 
other auction sites. eBay’s success forced many other auction sites to shut 
down. Recently, an auction site run by Yahoo! had to shut down as it could 
not attract enough visitors.
